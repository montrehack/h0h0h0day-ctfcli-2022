description: I managed to clone Santa's USB key which contains all his darkest secrets. I could use it to blackmail him to finally get out of the naughty list, but it is encrypted with something called BitLocker, can you help me open it? I have the recovery key file, but it is corrupted and unreadable, maybe you will be able to do something with it?
