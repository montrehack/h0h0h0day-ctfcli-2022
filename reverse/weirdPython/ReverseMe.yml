description: My friend showed me this Python programme that takes a single parameter and tells you wether it's the intended flag or not. He told me that if I could understand it and find the parameter, then I would finally reach his level! The problem is that I don't understand Python... Can you help me?

flags:
      - FLAG{n0w_th4t5_r3v3rs1ng!}
